## <p align="center">Welcome to my GitHub profile! ✨ 
  
I am currently a senior at Belmont University studying computer science with an emphasis on cybersecurity. I have experience in fullstack development, web development, networking, security analyzation, and app development! I am passionate about the world of computer science and I am always trying to learn new things and challenge myself.🩷 

Outside of tech, I enjoy playing video games (I'm a huge Dead by Daylight enthusiast), watching reality TV, eating yummy food, or spending time with my cat, Tulip. 🐱 </p>
